# Mp3-Sorter
Small script to sort a mass of Mp3s by their Artist-Metadata


Put all files into one directory, and execute this script from the same directory.
It will create a new directory with the Name of the Artist stated in the metadata of the file and copy the file to the new directory.
It only copies UNLESS EXISTS so sourefile stays at sourcedestination and Name-Duplicates will not overwrite destination.
